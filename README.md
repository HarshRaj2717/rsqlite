# rsqlite

A simple SQLite clone written in rust.

> This is a hobby project and obviously meant for "*production*" ;)

## Contributions

This repo is completely **open to contributions**, feel free to raise an issue or make a PR.

This is my first time using rust at anything (I have only written a "hello world" before which was an year ago), so there might be some issues here are there in my implementation.

## Archived Info

This repo has been archived as I moved bit separate from the sqlite plan onto making something more personalised, you can find the continued project at [SomeQL](https://github.com/HarshRaj2717/SomeQL).
